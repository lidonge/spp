# Service Plus Plus(S++)

S++ is a service (or microservices) modeling language.

## Concept Introduction

- **Behavior**: Activities with intrinsic logic and purpose.
- **Object**: A natural entity in the real world.
- **Participant**: The role of the participating behavior, it must be played by the object.

S++ redefines the services in SOA: **Service is the sum of a set of business activities**. Business modeling can be done in a different way than object-oriented through S++.

Recommended reading [["S++ Concepts and Applications"]](./docs/concept.md) for details.
